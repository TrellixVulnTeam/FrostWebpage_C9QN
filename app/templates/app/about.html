            <p>I have loved growing up in Maine, and I have loved growing up with 4 siblings! Being the fourth boy, 
            I had a lot of older brothers to look up to and learn from. It always a good time being around my siblings, 
            parents, and extended family. Family is a huge part of my life, and I hope to maintain a close relationship 
            with all of them.</p>

                I like to live by the motto: "Work hard, play hard", so whenever I'm not busy with school or work 
                I am usually active in doing the hobbies that I love. I really enjoy being outside whenever I can: 
                Rock climbing, canyoneering, backpacking, and just travelling in general 
                are some of my favorite things to do.  The cold doesn't even scare me! During the winter I enjoy 
                snowshoeing and skiing. I try to find any reason I can to get outside, be active, and enjoy what nature 
                has to offer.

                Some of my favorite travel experiences have been backpacking through Denali National Park in Alaska, 
                canyoneering through Old Bill Canyon in Red Rocks National Conservation, and backcountry skiing through 
                some of the best snow on earth in Utah. Despite all of these trips, there are a lot of times where 
                there is nothing better than sitting at home and watching a movie.
